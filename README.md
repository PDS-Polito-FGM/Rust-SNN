# Spiking Neural Network library

## Description
This is a `Rust library` aiming to model a `Spiking Neural Network`. It is carried out for the `group project` relating to the "Programmazione di Sistema" course of the Politecnico di Torino, a.y. 2021-2022.

The library provide support for the implementation of `Spiking Neural Network` models to be executed over spikes datasets.
It does *not* support the training phase of the network.
